# About

[![Mozilla HTTP Observatory Grade](https://img.shields.io/mozilla-observatory/grade-score/www.mcmk.in?publish)](https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/www.mcmk.in) [![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fmcmeeking%2Fwww.mcmk.in.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fmcmeeking%2Fwww.mcmk.in?ref=badge_shield)

I set this site up in my spare time so I'd have a place I could detail things I've been working on or thinking about, along with any docs or files that might be of interest. I'm aiming to post here at least once a month, maybe more, but will try to keep things interesting and focused on a particular topic at a time.

My interests, in no particular order, are:

- Technology
- Science
- Philosophy
- MMA
- Learning

So my meanderings will likely skew in one or more of those directions as this blog starts to take form.

If any of that stuff interests you, feel free to drop me a line.

Thanks for reading :heart:
